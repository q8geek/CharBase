# CharBase

CharBase is a JSON-based database software I made aimed for writers and story tellers to have a file with details of their stories.

This software can now:
  1.  Add, delete, edit, and list details and photos of:
    a.  Characters.
    b.  Locations.
    c.  Events.
  2.  Load\save JSON-based charbase files.
  3.  Alarms you if you're about to close the software without saving latest updates.
  
Future features:
  1.  Adding multiple pictures for an item.
  2.  Display relations between different items.
  3.  Items tracking.
